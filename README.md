# Heart Failure Prediction

This notebook is a demonstration of how to predict heart failure mortality based on a set of variables using Kaggle's Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that affects millions of people around the world. Predicting heart failure mortality is important to help improve health care and save lives.

## Goal
The purpose of this notebook is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting heart failure mortality based on the given variables.


## Prerequisites

To run this notebook you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and imblearn
